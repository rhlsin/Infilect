As a first step, you can head over to https://huew.co and test it out manually.
and then write a script that does the workflow automatically as in the video. (https://youtu.be/0zfymwDR66E),
For your purpose, use your own gmail id/password but make it readable from a file in your your solution, project. While we test we will
change the username and password to our test account.Use the attached fashion photo as input. You can save this in your project .

Step for running 
Extracr repo to your local 
set your workplace 
add your username and password to the code 
give the path of the upload photo in the code 
then you can run it or see the step wise debugging process.
